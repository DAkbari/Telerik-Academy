# Rectangles

## Description
Write an expression that calculates rectangleâ€™s perimeter and area by given **width** and **height**. 
The **width** and **height** should be read from the console.

## Input
- The input will consist of 2 lines:
  - On the first line, you will receive a floating-point number that will represent the **width** of the rectangle.
  - On the second line, you will receive another floating-point number that will represent the **height** of the rectangle.

## Output
- Output a single line - the rectangle's **perimeter** and **area**, separated by a **whitespace**.
  - Print the **perimeter** and **area** values with _exactly 2-digits precision_ after the floating point

## Constraints
- The **width** and **height** will always be valid floating-point numbers.
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **8MB**
