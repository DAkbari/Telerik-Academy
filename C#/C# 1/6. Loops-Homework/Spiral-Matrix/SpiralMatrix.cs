/*Problem 17. Spiral Matrix
  Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 20) and prints a matrix 
  holding the numbers from 1 to N*N in the form of square spiral like in the examples below.
  The input will always consist of a single line containing a single number - N.
  Output a spiral matrix as described below.
  Constraints: N will always be a valid integer number. 1 ≤ N ≤ 20
  Examples:
            n = 2   matrix      n = 3   matrix      n = 4   matrix
                    1 2                 1 2 3               1  2  3  4
                    4 3                 8 9 4               12 13 14 5
                                        7 6 5               11 16 15 6
                                                            10 9  8  7                  */
