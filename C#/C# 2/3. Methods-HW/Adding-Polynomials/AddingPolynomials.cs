/*  11. Adding polynomials
    Write a method that adds two polynomials. Represent them as arrays of their coefficients. 
    Write a program that reads two polynomials and prints their sum.
    Input: 
            On the first line you will receive the number N
            On the second line you will receive the first polynomial as coefficients separated by spaces
            On the third line you will receive the second polynomial as coefficients separated by spaces
   Output: Print the sum of the polynomials
   Constraints: 1 <= N <= 1024
   Sample tests:
